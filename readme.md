# Bookings and Reservations

This is the repository for my bookings and reservations project. The app is a result of the online course `Building Modern Web Applications with Go` from Trevor Sawler on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go/).

- Built in Go version 1.19
- Uses the [chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/v5)
- Uses [alex edwards SCS](https://github.com/alexedwards/scs/v2) session management
- Uses [nosurf](https://github.com/justinas/nosurf)
